Express Server with React Client

Created an application which displays names of employees for a company and emails of these employees when the user is logged in and authenticated.

A RESTful API was created using Javascript, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL. 
Clients of the API should be able to log into the API and then provide data to authorized clients. 
Implemented the front end client for the express server using React.
Authentication of users was implemented using Auth0.
The code was unit tested using Jest.

Tech Stack: Javascript, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, React, CSS, HTML, Jest, Git

To get started:
Create a database following the instructions in the database textfile.
Add the employee data to your database.
In your IDE run 'nmp install' in the terminal for both the altFrontend and altBackend folders.
In the dbconnections.js file change the password to your database's password.
In the altBackend folder run 'npm index.js' in the terminal to start the server.
In the altFrontend folder run 'npm start' to start the React app in your web browser.
On the React app page press the login button and create an account or login with a google account.
Have fun using the application.

Usage of the project is for displaying employee names and emails for authorized users for a company in any easy to use, accessible app
